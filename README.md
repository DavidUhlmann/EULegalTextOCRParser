# EU Legal Text OCR Parser
Creates JSON objects from EU Legal text for better AI input.\
When working with Legal Text in the EU people often parse long PDFs into tools like ChatGPT.
However, the PDF parser of those tools, even on premium, seems to hallucinate and/or end parsing those legal text after a certain amount of pages.
That is where this small repo jumps in.
Use the Python file to create machine readable JSON files instead of a PDF. Those files will (very likely) be read in fully by the AI tool and will decrease the liklyhood of hallucinations in your session.
Hope this helps.
